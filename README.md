# Jorge Alberto Mendoza II ⚛🖥🐶

Hey 🙋‍♂️, my name is Jorge Mendoza and I am a Front-End Software Engineer who focuses on creating accessible and performant user experiences on the web. With a fine eye for detail and a passion for learning, I am always searching for ways to improve the quality of the web for all users. In my senior year of college I took an introduction to web-development course, and since then I have continued to learn about the latest advances in the web-development environment and improve as a developer. I have used React, TypeScript, Styled-Components and other tools to create user-interfaces that are responsive, performant, and accessible. From developing password generators to full-stack applications with authentication and integration testing, I have a set of skills that allow me to plan, test, and create user interfaces.
